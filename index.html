                            <h2>About Me</h2>

                        <p>I am a Software Engineering student and I reside in Raleigh, NC. I graduated from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University
                        with a Bachelors Degree in Animal Science. </p>
                        <p>Aside from loving on animals, I paint, I practice yoga and try to squeeze in daily meditations. It has become a goal of mine to keep my space as calm and peaceful 
                            as possible because the outside world can be pretty chaotic. I am learning about chakras and 
                        having fun experimenting with different methods to open them up. </p>
                    
                            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
                     
                        <p>As a new student at Thinkful, I am excited to see where I will fit into the tech world. Learning Javascript has been one of the most challenging things
                        I've ever tried to do. It's teaching me how to study and become more disciplined. Programming is also teaching me to ask for help. I have always 
                        struggled with that before. Working in groups and getting feed back from others used to terrify me. When working with others, 
                        there are less errors and more brains being put together to solve a problem. </p>
                        <p>So far I am really enjoying the Front End Development portion of the program. I hope that I get to show more of my creative side through web pages.</p>
